    <ul>
      <li><strong>What is Steam?</strong> - Steam is an online platform from 
        game developer Valve where you can buy, play, create, and discuss PC 
        games. The platform hosts thousands of games (as well as downloadable 
        content, or DLC, and user-generated features called "mods") from major
        developers and indie game designers alike.</li>
      <li><strong>How does Steam work?</strong> - Steam is a cloud-based 
        gaming library. One of its most popular features is the ability for 
        users to use any computer to play games they buy/downloadto their 
        Steam accounts. This also allows users to store a large collection of 
        games without using too much computer memory. To use Steam, you have 
        to download and install the Steam "engine" or app on your computer. 
        Once you do that, you can access the full library of games, software,
        and forums.</li>
      <li><strong>History of Steam</strong> - Valve had entered into a 
        publishing contract with Sierra Studios in 1997 ahead of the 1998
        release of Half-Life.  The contract had given some intellectual 
        property (IP) rights to Sierra in addition to publishing control. 
        Valve published additional games through Sierra, including expansions
        for Half-Life and Counter-Strike. Around 1999, as Valve started work
        on Half-Life 2 and the new Source engine, they became concerned about
        their contract with Sierra related to the IP rights, and the two 
        companies renegotiated a new contract by 2001. The new contract eliminated 
        Sierra's IP rights and gave Valve rights to digital distribution of its
        games.</li>
      <li><strong>Privacy and security</strong> - The popularity of Steam
        has led to the service's being attacked by hackers. An attemp
        occurred in November 2011, when Valve temporarily closed the 
        community forums, citing potential hacking threats to the service. 
        Days later, Valve reported that the hack had compromised one of its 
        customer databases, potentially allowing the perpetrators to access
        customer information; including encrypted password and credit card 
        details. At that time, Valve was not aware whether the intruders 
        actually accessed this information or discovered the encryption 
        method, but nevertheless warned users to be alert for fraudulent
        activity.</li>
      <li><strong>Platforms</strong> - You can play and manage your steam account
        from following platforms:
        
        <ul>
          <li>Microsoft Windows</li>
          <li>MacOs</li>
